# UFOs Project
Request for UFO project client Dana

## Project Overview

Client requests a UFO webpage that will have a dynamic table which allows the user to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

This webpage is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Software

* VSCode Text Editor
* HTML
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Results 

### Project Process
1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

* The project is developed for showcasing UFO sitings data. 
* The webpage needed to be professionally designed using HTML and CSS. 
* Interactivity needed to be added with Javascript and D3. (**D3 is a useful javascript library for working with data-driven websites**) 
* A table of UFO sitings needed to be added to the site along with filtering capability to present the new table data

# My Recommendation

This webpage has room for improvement. A negative impact of the current design is that it is not immediately obvious that the table is dynamically updated. 

Users might be expecting a button that explicitly says "Filter" or "See Results" and this new design might be confusing.

Here are four specific actionable recommendations:

1. Create multiple pages for the entry results. As the total number of entries in this list increases, this webpage will become clunky and difficult to scroll thorugh so many entries. 
2. create a button that allows the user to choose how many results are shown per page (25, 50, 100, etc.).
3. A clear button can be add or when the input boxes are changed the data table changes live aswell. 
4. Create sorting functions. As the number of results grow, users may want an ability to sort the results to see more relevant data. Examples include sorting by Date (Ascending/Descending) or by City Name (A to Z, Z to A).
